# CeLeaste

This is a mod that replaces Madeline's entire set of sprites, allowing you to play as Lea from CrossCode.

Requires [Everest mod loader](https://everestapi.github.io/) and [Skin Mod Helper Plus mod](https://gamebanana.com/mods/473796) to function.

This mod's changes are:	 
- Madeline sprites are replaced with custom Lea sprites.  
- So are the world map player icons,  
- as well as Madeline's dialogue portraits and textboxes.  
  - But the dialogue and story are unchanged. That's beyond the scope of this mod.  
- A new spinning animation was added for super/hyper/wavedashes and wall bounces based on CrossCode's dodge/dash.  
- Animations from the following mods were added:  
  - HonlyHelper (pet animation)  
  - CollabUtils2 (sitting)  
  - XaphanHelper (grabbing onto a ceiling, sliding, spin jump)  
- And maybe something else I forgot about.  

The mod has two character options in game: "Lea" and "Lea (less fancy)". "Lea" is recommended, but if you find spinning hyperdashes distracting, pick "Lea (less fancy)" - it removes spinning dashes and error-like swimming animations.

This is my first Celeste mod, and I think it turned out quite well. Huge thanks to the members of Celeste's discord server for helping me along the way.

btw play CrossCode if you haven't already, it's great
